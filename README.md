# CSIT121 Assessments

Object-Oriented Design and Programming with Python

## Description

This repo consists of three assessments A1, A2, and A3 which intend to implement OOP and MVC practises into simple CLI programs. The first assessment (A1) creates different dairy-related products, appended to an array based on category (i.e. milk). The system provides the user with the ability to record a new product, search all products (grouped) and search more specific details about products by a category search. The second assessment (A2) records information about a user and then suggests a recommended daily intake based on those parameters (i.e. 5 servings of vegetables). Additionally, the weighted amounts of certain foods are calculated to give the user an idea of what foods in that category respond to that serving size. The third assessment (A3) also records user information and requires the average daily dietary servings a user consumes in a day. This program then similarly calculates the recommended daily intake but visualises the differences in the user's expected vs observed using MatPlotLib graphs. This information is stored in a binary file that can be read and updated for future use. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

There are no prerequisites or dependencies for these programs. 

### Installing

Ensure that Python3 is installed on your machine. To quickly check this run the following and if an error is returned, python3 must be installed. 
```
python3 --version
```
To install the most recent version of python, use www.python.org or:
```

```

### Executing program

To execute each program run the following commands:
```shell
cd <repo-dir>
python3 <filename>.py
```
There are three executables A1, A2, and A3 and two testing executables A2-test and A3-test.
